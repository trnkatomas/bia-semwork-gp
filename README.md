# Genetic Programming - symbolic regression
Semestral project for subject at FEE CTU called [Bio Inspired Algorithms] (http://www.fel.cvut.cz/education/bk/predmety/12/58/p12584904.html).

The main part written in Common-Lisp is a symbolic regression for multidimensional test functions (such as Ackley, Himmelblau, Bealy) implemented as genetic programming.
